# Code Style

- Write code that is correct, readable, and elegant — in that order.
- Idiomatic over clever. Follow established best practices and ecosystem conventions for the language.
- Don't copy existing patterns in the repo if they are of poor quality.
- Readability first: optimize only when there's a measured problem.
- No over-engineering. Extract abstractions at three or more call sites, not before.
- Dependencies: pragmatic — use what's well-maintained and saves real time.
- Prefer explicit over implicit.

# Naming

- Descriptive, even if long. Short only in tight scopes (loops, closures).
- No abbreviations at function/module level.

# Comments & Docs

- No comments that narrate what the code does.
- Document public API. Comment non-obvious "why" decisions — not "what".

# Testing

- TDD: write the test before the implementation.
- Table-driven / parametrized tests — one test function, many cases.

# Error Handling

- Fail fast in services — surface errors immediately, don't swallow them.
- Graceful degradation in user-facing code.
